# Channels Server

The TypeScript/JavaScript server library for Channels.

## Development

### Setup

1. Make sure you have the latest Node.js `8.x` LTS installed.
2. Open a terminal to this folder.
3. Run `npm install`

### Testing

Because this is a library, the most direct way to test this project is via unit tests.
These are the `file.spec.ts` files in the `src` directory. 
Everything is already setup so when a new `*.spec.ts` file is added, it will automatically be picked up by the test runner.

To run the tests, use the usual NPM test incantation:

```
> npm test
```
