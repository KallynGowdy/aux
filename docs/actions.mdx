## Data Actions

### `create(...mods)`

<FunctionCode name='create' />

Creates a new bot or combination of bots with the given mods. Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> on all the created bots.
By default, bots are created with a unique <TagLink tag='id'/>, <TagLink tag='auxCreator'/> set to the current `bot.id`, and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `"shared"`.

**Each parameter** is a mod that should be applied to the new bot(s).
If no parameters are specified, then the new bot will have its <TagLink tag='auxCreator'/> set to `bot.id` and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `"shared"`.
If an array of mods is used for a parameter, then one bot will be created for _each unique combination of mods_.

#### Examples:

1. Create an empty bot:
```typescript
let myNewBot = create();
```

2. Create a red bot:
```typescript
let myRedBot = create({
    auxColor: "red"
});
```

3. Create a parent and a child bot:
```typescript
let myParentBot = create({
    auxCreator: null,
    auxLabel: "Parent"
});
let myChildBot = create({
    auxCreator: getID(myParentBot),
    auxLabel: "Child"
});
```

4. Create a empty bot in the `"tempLocal"` space:
```typescript
let myBot = create({ space: "tempLocal" });
```

5. Create a bot from multiple mods:
```typescript
// myBot is placed in the "myContext" context and is colored green
let myBot = create({ myContext: true }, {
    auxColor: "green"
});
```

6. Create a red bot and a blue bot:
```typescript
let [myRedBot, myBlueBot] = create({ auxCreator: null}, [
    {
        "auxColor": "red"
    },
    {
        "auxColor": "blue"
    }
]);
```

### `destroy(bot)`

<FunctionCode name='destroy' />

Removes the given bot, list of bots, or bot by <TagLink tag='id'/> and triggers <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/> for each of the destroyed bots.

Note that only destroyable bots will be destroyed.
Bots which have <TagLink tag='auxDestroyable'/> set to `false` will not be destroyed.

Also note that all bots which have <TagLink tag='auxCreator'/> set to the <TagLink tag='id'/> of a destroyed bot will also be destroyed (unless they are not destroyable).
This happens recursively until there are no more bots to destroy.

#### Examples:

1. Destroying a single bot:
```typescript
// Destroy a single bot that has #name set to "bob"
destroy(getBot("#name", "bob"));
```

2. Destroying a list of bots:
```typescript
// Destroy all the bots that have #auxColor set to "red"
destroy(getBots("#auxColor", "red"));
```

3. Destroying a bot by its id
```typescript
// Destroy the bot with the #id: "config"
destroy("config");
```

### `getBots(..filters)`

<FunctionCode name='getBots' />

Gets an array of bots that match all of the given filter(s). The returned array is sorted alphabetically by the <TagLink tag='id'/> tag.

**Each parameter** is a [bot filter](#bot-filters). If no filters are specified, then all bots in the channel are returned.
If multiple filters are specified, then only the bots that match all of the filters are returned.

#### Examples

1. Find all bots with the "test" tag.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(byTag("#test"));
```

2. Find all bots with `#name` set to "bob" _and_ in the "people" context.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(byTag("#name", "bob"), inContext("people"));
```

### `getBots(tag, value?)`

<FunctionCode name='getBots' overload={1} />

Gets an array of bots that match the given tag and value. The returned array is sorted alphabetically by the <TagLink tag='id'/> tag.

The **first parameter** is the name of the tag. Bots that have this tag will be included as long as they also match the second parameter.

The **second parameter** is the value the tag should match. If not specified, then all bots with the tag will be included.
If specified, then only bots that have the same tag and value will be included. If you specify a function as the value, then it will be used to match tag values.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/> with <ActionLink action='byTag(tag, value?)' />
</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots with `#name` set to "bob".
```typescript
let bots = getBots("#name", "bob");

let bots = getBots("#test");
```

### `getBot(...filters)`

<FunctionCode name='getBot' />

Get the first bot that matches all of the given filter(s). If multiple bots match the given filter(s), then bots are sorted alphabetically by the <TagLink tag='id'/> tag and the first one is returned. If no bots match the given filter(s), then `undefined` is returned.

**Each parameter** is a [bot filter](#bot-filters). If no filters are specified, then the first bot in the channel is returned.
If multiple filters are specified, then the first bot that matches all of the filters is returned.

#### Examples

1. Find a bot with the "test" tag.
```typescript
let foundBot = getBot(byTag("#test"));

## Bot Filters

### `byTag(tag, value?)`

<FunctionCode name='byTag' />

Creates a bot filter which includes bots that have the given tag that matches the given value.

The **first parameter** is the name of the tag. Bots that have this tag will be included as long as they also match the second parameter.

The **second parameter** is the value that the tag should match. If not specified, then all bots with the tag will be included. 
If specified, then only bots that have the same tag value will be included. If you specify a function as the value, then it will be used to match tag values.

### `inContext(context)`

<FunctionCode name='inContext' />

Creates a bot filter which includes bots that are in the given context. That is, they have the given tag set to `true`.

The **first parameter** is the name of the context.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <ActionLink action='byTag(tag, value?)' /> with the `value` parameter set to `true`.
</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots in the "test" context.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(inContext("test"));
```

### `atPosition(context, x, y)`

Creates a bot filter which includes bots that are in the given context and at the given X and Y position.

When this filter is used with <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/>, the returned bots are sorted in the same order that they are stacked.
This means that the first bot in the array is at the bottom of the stack and the last bot is at the top of the stack (assuming they're stackable).

The **first parameter** is the name of the context.

The **second parameter** is the X position. That is, the left-right position of the bots in the context.

The **third parameter** is the Y position. That is, the forward-backward position of the bots in the context.

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots at (1, 2) in the "test" context.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(atPosition("test", 1, 2));
```

### `inStack(bot, context)`

Creates a bot filter which includes bots that are in the same stack as the given bot. The given bot will always be included by this filter as long the given bot is in the given context.

When this filter is used with <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/>, the returned bots are sorted in the same order that they are stacked.
This means that the first bot in the array is at the bottom of the stack and the last bot is at the top of the stack (assuming they're stackable).

The **first parameter** is the bot that other bots should be in the same stack with.

The **second parameter** is the name of the context.

#### Examples

1. Find all bots in the same stack as `this` in the "test" context.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(inStack(this, "test"));
```

### `byCreator(bot)`

<FunctionCode name='byCreator' />

Creates a bot filter which includes bots that were created by the given bot. That is, they have <TagLink tag='auxCreator' /> set to the <TagLink tag='id' /> of the given bot.

The **first parameter** is the bot that created the other bots.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <NormalCode>byTag("auxCreator", getID(bot))</NormalCode>.
</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots created by this bot.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(byCreator(this));
```

### `bySpace(space)`

<FunctionCode name='bySpace'/>

Creates a bot filter which includes bots that are in the given space. That is, they have <TagLink tag='space'/> set to the given value.

The **first parameter** is the space that the bots are in.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <NormalCode>byTag("space", space)</NormalCode>.
</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all bots in the `"tempLocal"` space.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(bySpace("tempLocal"));
```

## Event Actions

### `shout(name, arg?)`

<FunctionCode name='shout' />

Sends a shout to all bots that are <TagLink tag='auxListening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the specified name. Optionally includes a custom `that` argument.
Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the name of the shout. e.g. Using `"onClick"` for the name will trigger all <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listeners.

The **second parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots:
```typescript
shout("reset");
```

2. Send a `@hello` event with your name:
```typescript
shout("hello", "Bob");
```

### `whisper(bot, name, arg?)`

<FunctionCode name='whisper' />

Sends a whisper to the specified bot(s) that are <TagLink tag='auxListening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the given name. Optionally includes a custom `that` argument.
Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the bot, array of bots, bot <TagLink tag='id'/>, or array of bot <TagLink tag='id'/> that the whisper should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the whisper. e.g. Using `"onClick"` for the name will trigger the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listener for the specified bots.

The **third parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots named `"Bob"`:
```typescript
let bots = getBots("#name", "Bob");
whisper(bots, "reset");
```

2. Send a `@setColor` event to ourself:
```typescript
whisper(this, "setColor", "red");
```

## Player Actions

### `player.replaceDragBot(botOrMod)`

<FunctionCode name='replaceDragBot'/>

Replaces the bot that the user is dragging with the given bot or mod.
Only works if called from inside a <TagLink tag='@onBotDrag'/> or <TagLink tag='@onAnyBotDrag'/> listen tag.

The **first parameter** is the bot or mod that should be dragged. 
If given a bot, then that bot's <TagLink tag='@onBotDrag'/> will be skippped but <TagLink tag='@onBotDrop'/> will be called.

#### Examples:

1. Drag a clone of this bot.
```typescript
let clone = create(this);
player.replaceDragBot(clone);
```

2. Drag a mod that makes other bots red.
```typescript
player.replaceDragBot({
    "auxColor": "red"
});
```

## Server Actions

### `server.setupChannel(channel, botOrMod?)`

<FunctionCode name='setupChannel'/>

Sends an action to the server which will create the given channel if it does not exist and places a clone of the given bot or mod in it.
The new bot will only be added to the channel if the channel did not exist.
The action is only executed if <TagLink tag='@onChannelAction'/> has been configured to perform events in `device` actions.

The **first parameter** is the ID of the channel that should be setup.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the bot or mod that should be cloned into the new channel. After the bot is created, <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> will be triggered.

#### Examples:

Before `server.setupChannel()` will work, you need to setup the <TagLink tag='@onChannelAction'/> tag to execute events from remote devices.
This is because when you run `server.setupChannel()` from a PC or phone (a.k.a. A "remote device"), it needs to send an event to the server to actually create the new channel.
By default, AUX does not perform actions which are received from a remote device. You must instruct AUX to execute these yourself.

Ensure that <TagLink tag='@onChannelAction'/> is setup properly.
The following script will execute `setup_channel` events which were sent from other devices:
```typescript
// Device actions are actions which were sent to this computer from another device
if (that.action.type === 'device') {

    // The setup_channel action is the action that is created
    // from server.setupChannel()
    if (that.action.event.type === 'setup_channel') {

        // Execute the setup_channel action
        action.perform(that.action.event);
    }
}
```

1. Create the "test" channel:
```typescript
server.setupChannel("test");
```

2. Create the "test" channel with a bot inside it:
```typescript
server.setupChannel("test", {
    "name": "bob",
    "auxColor": "red"
});
```

3. Create the "test" channel with a bot that creates the "abc" context and places a bot in it:
```typescript
server.setupChannel("test", {
    "onCreate": `@
        create({
            auxCreator: null,
            auxContext: "abc",
        });

        create({
            auxCreator: null,
            auxLabel: "This is in the context!",
            auxColor: "blue",
            abc: true
        });

        destroy(this);
    `
});
```
