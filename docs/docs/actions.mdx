## Data Actions

### `create(...mods)`


Creates a new bot or combination of bots with the given mods. Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> on all the created bots.
By default, bots are created with a unique <TagLink tag='id'/>, <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to the current `bot.id`, and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `shared`.

If <TagLink tag='creator'/> references a non-existent bot or a bot with a different <TagLink tag='space'/> than the created bot, then <TagLink tag='creator'/> will be set to `null`.

**Each parameter** is a mod that should be applied to the new bot(s).
If no parameters are specified, then the new bot will have its <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to `bot.id` and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `shared`.
If an array of mods is used for a parameter, then one bot will be created for _each unique combination of mods_.

#### Examples:

1. Create an empty bot:
```typescript
let myNewBot = create();
```

2. Create a red bot:
```typescript
let myRedBot = create({
    color: "red"
});
```

3. Create a parent and a child bot:
```typescript
let myParentBot = create({
    creator: null,
    label: "Parent"
});
let myChildBot = create({
    creator: getID(myParentBot),
    label: "Child"
});
```

4. Create a empty bot in the `tempLocal` space:
```typescript
let myBot = create({ space: "tempLocal" });
```

5. Create a bot from multiple mods:
```typescript
// myBot is placed in the "myDimension" dimension and is colored green
let myBot = create({ myDimension: true }, {
    color: "green"
});
```

6. Create a red bot and a blue bot:
```typescript
let [myRedBot, myBlueBot] = create({ creator: null}, [
    {
        "color": "red"
    },
    {
        "color": "blue"
    }
]);
```

### `destroy(bot)`


Removes the given bot, list of bots, or bot by <TagLink tag='id'/> and triggers <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/> for each of the destroyed bots.

Note that only destroyable bots will be destroyed.
Bots that have <TagLink tag='destroyable'/> set to `false` will not be destroyed.

Also note that all bots that have <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to the <TagLink tag='id'/> of a destroyed bot will also be destroyed (unless they are not destroyable).
This happens recursively until there are no more bots to destroy.

#### Examples:

1. Destroying a single bot:
```typescript
// Destroy a single bot that has #name set to "bob"
destroy(getBot("#name", "bob"));
```

2. Destroying a list of bots:
```typescript
// Destroy all the bots that have #color set to "red"
destroy(getBots("#color", "red"));
```

3. Destroying a bot by its id
```typescript
// Destroy the bot with the #id: "config"
destroy("config");
```

### `applyMod(bot, ...mods)`


Applies the given mods to the given bot.

The **first parameter** is the bot that the mods should be applied to.

The **other parameters** are the mods that should be applied to the bot. If two mods have the same tag, then the mod that is last in the list will win.

#### Examples

1. Set the "test" tag and "name" tag on a bot.
```typescript
applyMod(bot, {
    test: true,
    name: "bob"
});
```

### `subtractMods(bot, ...mods)`


Removes the tags contained in the given mod(s) from the given bot or mod.

The **first parameter** is the bot or mod that the tags should be removed from.

The **other parameters** are the bots or mods that contain the tags which should be removed from the original bot.

#### Examples:

1. Remove a mod from this bot.
```typescript
const mod = {
    color: 'red',
    name: 'bob'
};

subtractMods(this, mod);
```

2. Remove multiple mods from this bot.
```typescript
subtractMods(this, {
    color: 'red'

### `atPosition(dimension, x, y)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots that are in the given dimension and at the given X and Y position.

When this filter is used with <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/>, the returned bots are sorted in the same order that they are stacked.
This means that the first bot in the array is at the bottom of the stack and the last bot is at the top of the stack (assuming they're stackable).

The **first parameter** is the name of the dimension.

### `inStack(bot, dimension)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots in the same stack as the given bot. The given bot will always be included by this filter as long the given bot is in the given dimension.

When this filter is used with <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/>, the returned bots are sorted in the same order that they are stacked.
This means that the first bot in the array is at the bottom of the stack and the last bot is at the top of the stack (assuming they're stackable).

The **first parameter** is the bot that other bots should be in the same stack with.

</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots created by this bot.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(byCreator(this));
```

### `bySpace(space)`


Creates a bot filter that includes bots in the given space. That is, they have <TagLink tag='space'/> set to the given value.

The **first parameter** is the space that the bots are in.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <NormalCode>byTag("space", space)</NormalCode>.
</Alert>

Optionally takes a direction that the neighboring bots must be in.

The **first parameter** is the bot that the other bots need to be neighboring.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the other bots need to be in.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the neighboring direction to check. If not specified, then all of the supported directions will be checked.
Currently, the supported directions are `front`, `right`, `back`, and `left`. If an unsupported direction is specified, then no bots will be included.

#### Examples:

1. Find all bots in front of `this` bot in the `test` dimension.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(neighboring(this, "test", "front"));
```

1. Find all bots around `this` bot in the `test` dimension.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(neighboring(this, "test"));
```

### `either(...filters)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots which match any (i.e. one or more) of the given filters.

**Each parameter** is a bot filter.

#### Examples:

1. Find all bots with the `#name` `bob` or a `#height` of 2.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(
    either(
        byTag("#name", "bob"),
        byTag("height", 2)
    )
);
```

## Event Actions

### `shout(name, arg?)`


Sends a shout to all bots that are <TagLink tag='listening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the specified name. Optionally includes a custom `that` argument.
Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the name of the shout. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger all <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listeners.

The **second parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots:
```typescript
shout("reset");
```

2. Send a `@hello` event with your name:
```typescript
shout("hello", "Bob");
```

### `whisper(bot, name, arg?)`


Sends a whisper to the specified bot(s) that are <TagLink tag='listening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the given name. Optionally includes a custom `that` argument.
Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the bot, array of bots, bot <TagLink tag='id'/>, or array of bot <TagLink tag='id'/> that the whisper should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the whisper. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listener for the specified bots.

The **third parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots named `Bob`:
```typescript
let bots = getBots("#name", "Bob");
whisper(bots, "reset");
```

2. Send a `@setColor` event to ourself:
```typescript
whisper(this, "setColor", "red");
```

### `superShout(name, arg?)`


Sends a shout to all of the other stories that are loaded.

The **first parameter** is the name of the shout. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger all the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listeners.

The **second parameter** is the optional `that` argument to include with the shout.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `hello` super shout to all the loaded stories.
```typescript
superShout("hello");
```

### `remote(action, target?)`


Sends the given action to another player.

In CasualOS, all actions are messages which are placed in a queue and processed one at at time.

For example, the <ActionLink action='player.toast(message, duration?)'/> action queues a message which, when processed, will show a toast message.
However, before any action is performed, it is run through the <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> listener which can decide whether reject an action using <ActionLink action='action.reject(action)'/>.
This lets you write rules for what actions each player is allowed to take.

There are a couple special cases. First, when you send/receive an action from someone else (i.e. they sent an action to you using the <ActionLink action='remote(action)'/> function), it won't run by default.
Instead it is wrapped as a `device` action and sent to <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> for processing. This lets you decide whether to allow players to send messages to each other and what the effect of those messages are.
If you want to perform the action, you can use <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/> on the inner device action to queue it for execution.

The **first parameter** is the action to send.

The **second parameter** is optional and is a object specifing which player to send the action to. If not specified, then the action is sent to the server player.
If specified, then the action is sent to all players that match the given values. If given a string, then the action is sent to the player with the matching ID.

#### Examples:

1. Send a toast message to another player.
```typescript
// TODO: Get the bot ID of the other player.
const otherPlayerBotId = 'otherPlayerBotId';

// Create a toast action
const toastAction = player.toast('My message!');

// Send the action to the other player
// The toastAction will not be performed locally because
// it is being sent to another player.
remote(toastAction, otherPlayerBotId);
```

### `remoteWhisper(playerId, name, arg?)`

Sends a <TagLink tag='@onRemoteWhisper'/> shout to the player with the given ID or players if given a list of IDs.
This is useful for sending arbitrary messages to specific players.

The **first parameter** is the player ID or list of player IDs that the shout should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the event that is being sent. This is useful for telling the difference between different messages.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a "custom" message to another player.
```typescript
const otherPlayerBotId = "otherPlayerBotId";

// The other player will receive a @onRemoteWhisper with 
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
remoteWhisper(otherPlayerBotId, "custom", "Hello");
```

2. Send a message to all other players.
```typescript
const players = await server.players();
const playerId = getID(player.getBot());
const otherPlayers = players.filter(id => id !== playerId);

// All other players will receive a @onRemoteWhisper with
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
remoteWhisper(otherPlayers, "custom", "Hello");
```

### `remoteShout(name, arg?)`

Sends a <TagLink tag='@onRemoteWhisper'/> shout to all the players in the current story.
The listener will be triggered on all players connected to the story, including the local player.

The **first parameter** is the name of the message that is being sent. This is useful for telling the difference between different messages.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a message to all players.
```typescript
// All players will receive a @onRemoteWhisper with
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
remoteShout("custom", "Hello");
```

### `action.perform(action)`


Queues the given action to be performed at a later time.

The **first parameter** is the action that should be performed.

#### Examples:

1. Perform a toast message by manually queuing it.
```typescript
action.perform({
    type: 'show_toast',
    message: 'My toast message!',
    duration: 2000 // 2 seconds in miliseconds
});
```

## Server Actions

### `server.backupToGithub(auth)`


Saves all the stories to GitHub as a private Gist using the given authentication token.

Just like <ActionLink action='server.shell(script)'/>, you need 

The **first parameter** is the Github Personal Access Token that should be used to grant access to your Github account.
See https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line

<Alert type='info'>
    By default, backing up to GitHub is disabled on a story.
    To enable it, you have to write a custom <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> listener on the config bot and run an <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/>.
</Alert>

#### Examples:

1. Backup all the stories to a Github Gist.
```typescript
server.backupToGithub('your auth token');
```

### `server.backupAsDownload(target)`


Saves all the stories to a zip file and downloads it to the session matching the given target.

The **first parameter** is an object that indicates which session the zip file should be downloaded to.

<Alert type='info'>
    By default, backing up as a download is disabled on a story.
    To enable it, you have to write a custom <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> listener on the config bot and run an <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/>.
</Alert>

#### Examples:

1. Backup and download to this tab.
```typescript
server.backupAsDownload({
    session: getID(player.getBot())
});
```

### `server.finishCheckout(options)`

Finishes the checkout process by charging payment to the player.
Best used during the <TagLink tag='@onCheckout'/> shout.

The **first parameter** are the options needed to finish the checkout process.

#### Examples:

1. Finish the checkout process.
```typescript
server.finishCheckout({
    secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY',
    
    token: 'token from onCheckout',

    // 1000 cents == $10.00
    amount: 1000,
    currency: 'usd',
    description: 'Description for purchase'
});
```

### `server.setupStory(story, botOrMod?)`


Sends an action to the server that will create the given story if it does not exist and places a clone of the given bot or mod in it.
The new bot will only be added to the story if the story did not exist.
The action is only executed if <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> has been configured to perform events in `device` actions.

The **first parameter** is the ID of the story that should be setup.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the bot or mod that should be cloned into the new story. After the bot is created, <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> will be triggered.

#### Examples:

Before `server.setupStory()` will work, you need to setup the <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> tag to execute events from remote devices.
This is because when you run `server.setupStory()` from a PC or phone (a.k.a. A "remote device"), it needs to send an event to the server to actually create the new story.
By default, AUX does not perform actions that are received from a remote device. You must instruct AUX to execute these yourself.

Ensure that <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> is setup properly.
The following script will execute `setup_story` events that were sent from other devices:
```typescript
// Device actions are actions that were sent to this computer from another device
if (that.action.type === 'device') {

    // The setup_story action is the action that is created
    // from server.setupStory()
    if (that.action.event.type === 'setup_story') {

        // Execute the setup_story action
        action.perform(that.action.event);
    }
}
```

1. Create the "test" story:
```typescript
server.setupStory("test");
```

2. Create the "test" story with a bot inside it:
```typescript
server.setupStory("test", {
    "name": "bob",
    "color": "red"
});
```

3. Create the "test" story with a bot that places a bot in the "abc" dimension:
```typescript
server.setupStory("test", {
    "onCreate": `@
        create({
            creator: null,
            label: "This is in the dimension!",
            color: "blue",
            abc: true
        });

        destroy(this);
    `
});
```

### `server.browseHistory()`


Loads the `history` space into the current story.
The `history` space is read-only and contains all the marks that have been created for the story.
Each mark is a bot that is placed in the `#history` dimension.

#### Examples:

1. Load the `history` space.
```typescript
server.browseHistory();
```

### `server.markHistory(options)`


Marks the current state as a save point in history. This save point can be restored by using the <ActionLink action='server.restoreHistoryMark(mark)'/> action.
Note that this only saves bots in the `shared` space. `local` and `tempLocal` bots are unaffected.

The **first parameter** are the options that should be used to mark the history point.
It should be an object with the following properties:
- `message` - The message that the new mark should have. Use this as a way to communicate what was special about this save point.

#### Examples:

1. Save the current state of the `shared` space.
```typescript
server.markHistory({
    message: 'First Version of my AUX'
});
```

### `server.restoreHistoryMark(mark)`


Restores the current state to the state that was saved by the given mark.
This will create a new mark with any unsaved changes and another mark with the state that was saved by the given mark.

The **first parameter** is the bot or bot ID of the mark that should be restored. You can find available marks in the current story by using the <ActionLink action='server.browseHistory()'/> action.

#### Examples:

1. Restore the state to a given mark.
```typescript
// Find a random mark that was loaded by server.browseHistory()
let mark = getBot(byTag("#history", true));

// Restore the current state to the given mark.
server.restoreHistoryMark(mark);
```

### `server.restoreHistoryMarkToStory(mark, story)`


Restores the state in the given story to the state that was saved by the given mark.
This will create a new mark with any unsaved changes in the story and another mark with the state that was saved by the given mark.

The **first parameter** is the bot or bot ID of the mark that should be restored. You can find available marks in the current story by using the <ActionLink action='server.browseHistory()'/> action.

The **second parameter** is the story that the state should be restored to. If `null` or an empty string, then the current story will be restored.

#### Examples:

1. Restore the state of the `test` story to a given mark.
```typescript
// Find a random mark that was loaded by server.browseHistory()
let mark = getBot(byTag("#history", true));

// Restore the current state to the given mark.
server.restoreHistoryMarkToStory(mark, "test");
```

### `server.shell(script)`


Executes the given script on the server.

The **first parameter** is the shell script that should be executed.

<Alert type='info'>
    By default, shell scripts are disabled on a story.
    To enable them, you have to write a custom <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> listener on the config bot and run an <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/>.
</Alert>

### `server.loadFile(path, options?)`


Loads a file from the server at the given path.

Note that on a Raspberry PI, all USB storage devices are mapped into the `/drives` directory based on the port they were plugged into.
Loading a file from a USB drive is as simple as specifying the file name.
If multiple USB drives are plugged in and have files with the same name, then the file from the USB drive in the smallest numbered port is used.

The **first parameter** is the path that the file should be loaded from. This is usually just the full name of the file to load. (name + file extension)

The **second parameter** are the options that should be used for loading the file.

<Alert type='info'>
    By default, loading files is disabled on a story.
    To enable it, you have to write a custom <TagLink tag='@onStoryAction'/> listener on the config bot and run an <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/>.
</Alert>

#### Examples:

1. Load a file named "book.txt" and trigger a `@onBookLoaded` shout when it is loaded.
```typescript
server.loadFile('book.txt', {
    callbackShout: 'onBookLoaded'
});
```

2. Load a file named "book.txt" from drive `2` and trigger a `@onBookLoaded` shout when it is loaded.

Note that on a Raspberry PI, all USB storage devices are mapped into the `/drives` directory based on the port they were plugged into.
Saving a file to a USB drive is as simple as specifying the file name.
If multiple USB drives are plugged in and a drive is not specified, then the file will be saved to the first drive.

The **first parameter** is the path that the file should be saved to. This is usually just the full name of the file to save. (name + file extension)

The **second parameter** is the data that should be saved into the file.

The **third parameter** are the options that should be used for saving the file.

<Alert type='info'>

</Alert>

#### Examples:

1. Save a file named "book.txt" and trigger a `@onBookSaved` shout when it is saved.
```typescript
server.saveFile('book.txt', 'My memoirs', {
    callbackShout: 'onBookSaved'
});
```

2. Save a file named "book.txt" to drive `2` and trigger a `@onBookSaved` shout when it is loaded.
